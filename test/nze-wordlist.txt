hit hid hint
boot booed boo tune dune
bird curt burn
bat bad back bag ban
bet bed beck beg Ben
but bud buck bug bun
bark barn path laugh dance
bought bored born bore
book good put
beat bead beak bean
loud lout how cow town
tie tied tight pie pine
hay bay bait paid pay pain take
moat mow mowed moan
beer bear here hair ear air
spear spare shear share cheer chair
hid had hard hoard who'd hood head heard heed hud hod
groan grown moan mown throne thrown
weather which whether witch when wine while whine
ten shed add yes end bed
doll dole dull
school full wool will pool well
fill filling fall falling fool fooling four
milk child railway cold
ferry fairy herring hearing
city letter fatter ladder scatter better batter Peter
tour pour sure sewer skewer cure poor
street train tree dream
mother father nothing something
think thin with toothbrush breathe clothe beneath
milk silk sulk gold
